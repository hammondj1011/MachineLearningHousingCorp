# MachineLearningHousingCorp
We are using California Census Data to predict housing prices in the state!

This exercise is being done as an part of my effort to understand Machine Learning and the problems that this tool can solve.

This project will be written in Python using numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn. This is part of a broader exercise from O'Reilly's "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" (3rd ed.).
